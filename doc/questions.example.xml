  <question>
    This is the first question, but it could be moved around.  LaTeX can be freely used:
    $$x < 2 \Rightarrow p = \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 8 & 9\end{pmatrix}$$
    <choice correct>That is the correct answer, it could appear as A, B, or C.</choice>
    <choice>Incorrect answer appearing as A, B, or C.</choice>
    <choice>Incorrect answer appearing as A, B, or C.</choice>
    <choice fixed>Incorrect answer appearing as D (useful for ``none of the above'').</choice>
  </question>

  <question points=2 fixed>
    This is a question worth 2 points, which always appear in second position in
    the quiz (keyword \texttt{fixed}).
    <choice>Answer A, B, or C.</choice>
    <choice>Answer A, B, or C.</choice>
    <choice>Answer A, B, or C.</choice>
    <choice correct fixed>Answer D, which is correct.</choice>
  </question>

  <flush/>

  <question fixedanswers points=2>
    As we issued a \texttt{flush} just before, all the questions appearing
    before this one in the XML file will be output before it in the TeX output.
    Also, since this question has keyword \texttt{fixedanswers}, all the answers
    will appear in the order of the XML file.
    <choice>$L$ is undecidable.</choice>
    <choice>$L$ is Turing-recognizable, but not co-Turing-recognizable.</choice>
    <choice>$L$ is co-Turing-recognizable, but not Turing-recognizable.</choice>
    <choice correct>$L$ is regular.</choice>
  </question>

  <question fixedanswers onepar points=2 fixed>
    In this question, the answers are formated in a single paragraph, rather
    than each on their line.  It is the job of the TeX template to implement
    this flag; the script itsef has no notion of \text{onepar}.
    <choice correct>Yes.</choice>
    <choice>No.</choice>
    <choice>It is impossible to know.</choice>
    <choice>The question is not well-defined.</choice>
  </question>

  <question hideanswers fixedanswers>
    In this question, we explain answers A, B, C, D in the text, for some reason
    (my use case was some code where four lines where labeled A, B, C, and D).
    The TeX file will be in charge of not printing the choice of answers.
    (\texttt{fixedanswers} should thus be used---although, for historical
    reason, this is automatically the case.)
    <choice correct>A</choice>
    <choice>B</choice>
    <choice>C</choice>
    <choice>D</choice>
